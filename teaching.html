            <h2>Selected Teaching Evaluations</h2>        
            <ul id="evaluationsList">
                <li>Amazing quality – best instructor I have ever had in any context anywhere. Montek truly cares about his students and is a phenomenal teacher.</li>
                <li>Calc II is the only class I look forward to this semester because of Montek. He is a wonderful, knowledgeable, and understanding person that deserves a raise.</li>
                <li>Montek Singh Gill is one of the best goddamn teachers I have ever had. Somehow, he has managed to turn calculus into a fun class. The classroom is always lively, even when nobody understands what's being taught. He takes his time to gauge the room, and if he senses that we don't understand a concept he will wait for someone to ask a question before moving on, rather than simply cram in all the material as fast as possible. He genuinely cares that students understand mathematics, and will make sure that all questions are fully answered and that the student grasps the concept. Sometimes, he will show us cool facts about math, such as old proofs of common knowledge or fun facts (things like Gabriel's horn, a proof of why sqrt(2) is irrational, etc.). Sure, we don't have to learn that material for the course, but Montek is so full of passion for the subject that we are all willing to go along for the ride. Also, statistically we are a very highly performing section, with our section average being well above the course average for both exams. If none of this proves that Montek is an amazing teacher, then I don't know what could. If this man isn't given a promotion soon, or a raise, or whatever good things could come his way, then the world is truly unfair.</li>
                <li>Montek does a great job of explaining everything and using the class time to make sure we fully understand the concepts. He encourages us to ask questions if we don't understand anything, as well as asking questions during his office hours. He is always very prepared and knows exactly what he wants to talk about during the hour. Honestly one of the best math teachers I have ever had!</li>
                <li>I have had a great experience in this course. Montek is the best GSI I have had thus far in college. He is a good teacher and is always willing to help if you do not understand a problem or concept.</li>
                <li>Montek was my best teacher of my first semester at UMich, and one of the best teachers I've had in school.</li>
                <li>Montek is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He explains things very well and allows students to understand the concepts behind the math, not just how to manipulate numbers.</li>
                <li>Montek is a terrific instructor. He always makes sure we understand why we are doing whatever we are doing rather than just lecturing.</li>
                <li>I like that Montek shows us basic proofs of material or explains why something is the way it is, rather than just handing us the definition and calling it good, because it helps give some reasoning to the situation and some context.</li>
                <li>Montek is an amazing GSI with an excellent grasp on the material. He goes through the material quickly, which is sometimes a bit tough, but there’s tons of time to review before the exams. The material we learn is tough, but Montek explains it very well.</li>
                <li>The instructions given in this course are of high quality. Our instructor takes the time to thoroughly explain concepts by showing us many examples on the board before assigning more practice problems from the textbook. Also, he gives us multiple reminders of due dates for upcoming assignments and things we should do to be prepared for the next class and I personally find this very helpful.</li>
                <li>This course is instructed very well. Our instructor comes in prepared for all of the material. He always choose only practice problems that will be most valuable in helping us understand the material. He doesn't just lecture to us the material, but makes sure the entire class is included and involved in the teaching process. He makes sure everyone is following what is happening and will always make sure by asking individual students or the class as a whole if we have questions or need help. He promotes an environment where we have to work together with our classmates.</li>
                <li>Montek is the best instructor!</li>
                <li>Instructed extremely well. Open to questions, and willing to answer all questions fully. Made clear expectations of the class. Tried to get everyone involved and participating in discussion and group work.</li>
                <li>Montek is a great GSI, without him I wouldn't have been able to complete these labs. He was a great instructor for my first time using matlab.</li>
                <li>Amazing GSI!!</li>
                <li>Montek knows whats up. Nobody else does.</li>
                <li>Coolest GSI ever.</li>
                <li>Very well taught.</li>
                <li>Labs were very hard and confusing. Thank god for Montek or we would have never figured any of this stuff out. Also, when they brought the labs before for the test, I was very confused again. Once again, BLESS Montek he carried us through the course. He should get paid more.</li>           
                <li>Very knowledgeable instructor.</li>
                <li>Montek is a great person and teacher of the lecture material.</li>
                <li>Similar high quality of instruction in the lectures. The lab section was designed to supplement the material that we covered in class, and I think it did that job well. In addition, the GSI was very helpful both inside and outside class periods.</li>

                <li>Montek was easily the best instructor I have had thus far in the math department. Made lab a valuable and enjoyable experience.</li>
                <li>The instruction was great but the actual lab material was terrible. My GSI Montek was an excellent teacher nonetheless and really helped clarify what the heck the questions were asking for. He was also one of the best tutors in the Math Lab.</li>

                <li>Thanks for such a smooth semester. I've taken all of my calculus here and you are by far the best GSI I have had, hands down. Countless times you helped our lab group better understand a question or just a general topic. Appreciate how you handled the labs and thanks for a smooth semester.</li>
