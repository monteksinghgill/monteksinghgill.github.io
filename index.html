                I have broad interests, spanning mathematics, physics and computer science, among others. Currently, I work at Google as a Software Engineer, on such things as building machine learning models for classification problems.

                In 2020, I graduated with a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Michigan. My advisor was <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ikriz/">Igor Kriz</a> and my specialization was algebraic topology, or more specifically homotopy theory and higher category theory. The title of my thesis was <i>Stabilizations of E<sub>&#x221e;</sub> Operads and p-Adic Stable Homotopy Theory</i> and, in it, I constructed an algebraic model for p-adic stable homotopy theory via algebras over differential-graded operads, providing a stable version of a corresponding unstable result of Mandell.

                In 2015, I graduated with an MSc in Mathematics from the University of Sydney. My advisor was <a href="http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/tillmann/">Stephan Tillmann</a> and my specialization was geometric topology, or more specifically 3-manifold topology. The title of my thesis was <i>Representations of the Fundamental Groups of Triangulated 3-Manifolds</i> and, in it, I formulated a framework for constructing representations of the fundamental groups of triangulated 3-manifolds using combinatorial data, one which unified methods of Rubinstein-Tillmann and Luo, and studied and found a counterexample to a conjecture of Luo concerning a strong form of residual finiteness of 3-manifold groups.

                In 2014, I graduated with a BSc (Adv. Math.) in Mathematics, including an Honours year, from the University of Sydney. My Honours advisor was <a href="http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/tillmann/">Stephan Tillmann</a> and my specialization was geometric topology, or more specifically 3-manifold topology. The title of my thesis was <i>The Hyperbolic Gluing Equations Over Commutative Rings and a Residual Property of 3-Manifold Groups</i> and, in it, I proved a conjecture of Luo concerning a strong form of residual finiteness for 3-manifold groups for certain special classes of 3-manifolds. At the end of the Honours year, I was awarded First Class Honours and the University Medal.
